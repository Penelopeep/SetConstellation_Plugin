## Usage:
##### **/setconstellation** or **/sc** or **/setcons** [constellation number **1-6**]
##### Alternatively you can use **/sc all** to add every available constellation

Also don't use it on >1.2.2-dev versions of Grasscutter for two reasons:
1. Since version 1.2.3-dev Grasscutter now supports this command (thanks to [juuyokka](https://github.com/juuyokka))
2. It just won't work, using help causes error etc.

## FAQ

1. How to install plugin?
    - Add the newest jar file from [here](https://github.com/Penelopeep/SetConstellation_Plugin/releases), and put it in **GrasscutterFolder/Plugins** (make one if you don't have)
2. I found a bug, where to report it?
   - Let me know on discord **<a href="https://discord.com/users/276265598508466176">Penelopeep#7963</a>** or make a pull request with fix
3. Your error handling sucks
    - You're right, if you know how to make proper error handling then make pull request or dm me on discord **Penelopeep#7963**
